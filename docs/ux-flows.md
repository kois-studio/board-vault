# Core user flows

The primary product loop is:

1. create or join an invite-only group;
2. add private games and shared group context;
3. select participants and receive explainable recommendations;
4. plan or record a session;
5. preserve the session and play history for later decisions.

Every flow should define loading, empty, error, retry, permission, refresh, and
mobile states. Invitation and participant-claim flows must distinguish a real
account from a group-scoped placeholder and must not expose another account's
private collection.

Browser coverage should use disposable local databases and synthetic provider
identities. It must not depend on production data, personal accounts, or
committed browser storage state.
